        <p>Hi! My name is Jeremy Atkinson. I'm a structural engineer from Vancouver, Canada. I also like learning web development in my spare time. This site shows some of the things I've been working on. If you would like to get in touch with me, feel free to <a href="mailto:jeremy@jatkinson.me">send an email.</a></p>

                            <p>I am currently a student in the Structural and Earthquake Engineering department working on my Master of Applied Science degree
                                at UBC. I expect to graduate April 2017.</p>
                            <p>My thesis topic relates to the seismic design of tall buildings with core and outrigger systems. In it, I use a novel
                                energy-based design approach called Equivalent Energy Design Procedure (EEDP) to design 30-story and 40-story reinforced
                                concrete wall-and-outrigger buildings. The design considers multiple performance objectives at different seismic
                                hazards. In low-intensity earthquakes, the entire structure stays essentially elastic and undamaged. In medium-intensity
                                earthquakes, the outrigger system is designed to yield and dissipate energy through inelastic action (The system
                                can contain fuses such as Buckling-restrained-braces, which can be replaced after the earthquake). The walls remains
                                essentially-undamaged. In large-intensity earthquakes, both the outrigger and wall will yield and dissipate energy.
                                Damage is allowed to occur, but drifts are controlled and life-safety limit state is achieved. </p>
                            <p>The design methodology is shown to work through a series of nonlinear analyses using OpenSees, the Open System for Earthquake
                                Engineering Simulation. The prototype buildings are modelled and analyzed using a suite of earthquake ground motion
                                records scaled to each hazard level. At each hazard, the response of the system is compared to the intended performance
                                objectives. Finally, incremental dynamic analysis is used to assess the building performance under extreme events.
                                The Collapse margin ratio is calculated and shown to be acceptable for the buildings studied.</p>

As the name suggests, it is built for Hugo, a static website generator, and it uses Google’s Material Design Lite Library. The design is based off the example blog template provided by MDL. I extended the template to work with Hugo’s frontmatter and templating functions. It include three content types: blog posts, projects, bio section. It makes heavy use of cards, which are one of the primary methods of displaying content in Material Design.</p>
                        <p>I also created a Hugo Theme based on the MaterializeCSS framework. <a href="https://github.com/jchatkinson/hugo-materialized">The theme</a> features three main components - A bio, posts, and projects. The bio is laid out a bit like a resume. It automatically displays a few recent projects and posts, with some static content below. Posts are presumeably the most viewed part of the site, and appear prominently on the front page. Projects are displayed as cards with room for an image, title, description, and links to the repo and details. A simple sidenav is always available on larger screens, and reverts to a collapseable side-nav on smaller screens. </p></div>
