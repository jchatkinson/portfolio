                            <p>I did my Master of Applied Science (Civil Engineering) degree in the Structural and Earthquake Engineering department at the University of British Columbia.</p>
                            <p>My thesis topic relates to the seismic design of tall buildings with core and outrigger systems. In it, I use a novel
                                energy-based design approach called Equivalent Energy Design Procedure (EEDP) to design 20, 30, and 40-story reinforced
                                concrete wall-and-outrigger buildings. The design considers multiple performance objectives at different seismic
                                hazards. In low-intensity earthquakes, the entire structure stays essentially elastic and undamaged. In medium-intensity
                                earthquakes, the outrigger system is designed to yield and dissipate energy through inelastic action (The system
                                can contain fuses such as Buckling-restrained-braces, which can be replaced after the earthquake). The walls remains
                                essentially-undamaged. In large-intensity earthquakes, both the outrigger and wall will yield and dissipate energy.
                                Damage is allowed to occur, but drifts are controlled and life-safety limit state is achieved. </p>
                            <p>The design methodology is shown to work through a series of nonlinear analyses using OpenSees, the Open System for Earthquake
                                Engineering Simulation. The prototype buildings are modelled and analyzed using a suite of earthquake ground motion
                                records scaled to each hazard level. At each hazard, the response of the system is compared to the intended performance
                                objectives. Finally, incremental dynamic analysis is used to assess the building collapse performance under extreme events.
                                The three prototype buildings are shown to have a suffiently small probability of collapse.</p>

It is written in python (using flask) and will be hosted on Google App Engine once finished.</p></div>

                            <p>Seismic design of tall buildings results in lots of data. When a building is analyzed, all the results need to be organized and manipulated to arrive at a set of forces for each element in the structure that we want to design. Previously, this was done manually through a series of spreadsheet functions, filters, sorting, etc. I quickly realized that alot of time could be saved by automating this data manipulation process, so I wrote a MATLAB program to do it for me and compiled it to a standalone executable that can be installed on any computer. It has saved countless hours of time, allowing me to spend more time on the structural design and less time on the boring stuff.</p>
                            <p>It is very much a work-in-progress, as there are always little improvements and additional features that can be incorporated. Unfortuneately, the project is not open-source, as it was written on company time. </p>

As the name suggests, it is built for Hugo, a static website generator, and it uses Google’s Material Design Lite Library. The design is based off the example blog template provided by MDL. I extended the template to work with Hugo’s frontmatter and templating functions. It include three content types: blog posts, projects, bio section. It makes heavy use of cards, which are one of the primary methods of displaying content in Material Design.</p>
                        <p>I also created a Hugo Theme based on the MaterializeCSS framework. <a href="https://github.com/jchatkinson/hugo-materialized">The theme</a> features three main components - A bio, posts, and projects. The bio is laid out a bit like a resume. It automatically displays a few recent projects and posts, with some static content below. Posts are presumeably the most viewed part of the site, and appear prominently on the front page. Projects are displayed as cards with room for an image, title, description, and links to the repo and details. A simple sidenav is always available on larger screens, and reverts to a collapseable side-nav on smaller screens. </p></div>
